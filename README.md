# the-block-project-matchmaker

Summary of our project:
There are more than 20,000 people that are homeless in Washington.Surprisingly, about half of those people are employed.
Many are in the merge of losing their jobs without having access to basic needs such as a shelter or even just the ability to take a shower.
This is a vicious cycle that we want to put an end to. 
Through Block Project, we believe we can eliminate this problem by moving people who are homeless into our neighborhoods' backyards through easy and simple matching process between potential hosts and residents.

This is a web application for an organization called Facing Homelessness to provide them a working application to use.
Prospective hosts and residents of the Block Project will use this application to register, sign-up, edit and publish profiles, and find hosts. 
For our front-end and back-end digital platform, we used Windows ASP.NET Cloud-based Web Application with Azure database as we will be able
to scale well if this project launch and migration into the actual project seemed to be successful. We really wanted to end saving data
to the local hard-drive because the we wanted to give the organization freedom to look at the data whenever and be able to use the web
application everywhere. Furthermore, FacingHomlessness gets $5,000 Azure credit every year which made it more reasonable to go with
full Microsoft stack that we went with.
